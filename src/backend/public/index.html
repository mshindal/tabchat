		<p>
			Tabchat is a browser extension that allows you
			to leave comments on any webpage for others to see.
			It's still in development - but it's coming soon!

		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
				Tabchat is built to be privacy conscious and only stores the 
				bare minimum amount of data needed for it to function. When 
				you navigate to a webpage with Tabchat installed, the URL of 
				the webpage is sent to Tabchat, so that it can return the list
				of comments that were posted to that webpage. If you choose to
				post a comment, the contents of that comment will be sent to 
				Tabchat and stored. This comment will then be viewable by 
				anyone else using Tabchat. <strong>No personally identifying 
				information is stored</strong>, and <strong>no data is shared 
				with any third party</strong>.

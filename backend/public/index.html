		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
      Tabchat is built to be privacy conscious and only stores the 
      bare minimum amount of data needed for it to function. When 
      you navigate to a webpage with Tabchat installed, the URL of 
      the webpage is sent to Tabchat, so that it can return the list
      of comments that were posted to that webpage. If you choose to
      post a comment, the contents of that comment will be sent to 
      Tabchat and stored. Your comment will then be viewable by anyone 
      else using Tabchat. <strong>No personally identifying information 
      is stored by Tabchat</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabchat uses Google's reCAPTCHA to prevent spam. Some of your 
      behavior is sent to Google for it to analyze whether you're a bot
      or not.
